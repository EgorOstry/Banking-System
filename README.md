# Simple-Bank-System
Study python/SQL project.

The project shows my OOP and SQLite experience.
The system creates accounts using the Luhn algoritm and stores them into DB.
Account data include card number, pin-code and balance.
The system allows to add money, to make transfer and to close an account.
All the activities are supported with DB verifications, for example, 
in order to make a money transfer the system checks if an account you try to transfer money to exists and if it passes Luhn algoritm.

Code - banking.py;
Database - card.s3db;
