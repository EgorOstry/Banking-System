# Simple-Bank-System
Study python/SQL project.

The project shows my OOP and SQLite experience.
The system creates accounts using the Luhn algoritm and store them into DB.
Accounts include card number, pin-code and balance.
The system allows to add money, to make transfer and to close an account.
All the activities are supports with DB verifications, for example, 
in order to make a money transfer the system firstly check if there is an account you try to transfer money to, and if it's passes Luhn algoritm.

Code - banking.py;
Database - card.s3db;
